PREFACE.

THE WANT OF AN INTERESTING WORK ON GREEK AND ROMAN MYTHOLOGY, SUITABLE FOR
THE REQUIREMENTS OF BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS, HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE
PRINCIPALS OF OUR ADVANCED SCHOOLS. THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS THEMSELVES,
EVEN WHERE THE ATTAINMENTS OF THE PUPIL HAVE RENDERED THIS FEASIBLE, HAS
NOT BEEN FOUND ALTOGETHER SUCCESSFUL IN GIVING TO THE STUDENT A CLEAR AND
SUCCINCT IDEA OF THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE ANCIENTS, AND IT HAS BEEN
SUGGESTED THAT A WORK WHICH WOULD SO DEAL WITH THE SUBJECT AS TO RENDER IT
AT ONCE INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE WOULD BE HAILED AS A VALUABLE
INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF CLASSIC AUTHORS, AND WOULD BE FOUND TO ASSIST
MATERIALLY THE LABOURS OF BOTH MASTER AND PUPIL.

IN ENDEAVOURING TO SUPPLY THIS WANT I HAVE SOUGHT TO PLACE BEFORE THE
READER A LIFELIKE PICTURE OF THE DEITIES OF CLASSICAL TIMES AS THEY WERE
CONCEIVED AND WORSHIPPED BY THE ANCIENTS THEMSELVES, AND THEREBY TO AWAKEN
IN THE MINDS OF YOUNG STUDENTS A DESIRE TO BECOME MORE INTIMATELY
ACQUAINTED WITH THE NOBLE PRODUCTIONS OF CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY.

IT HAS BEEN MY AIM TO RENDER THE LEGENDS, WHICH FORM THE SECOND PORTION OF
THE WORK, A PICTURE, AS IT WERE, OF OLD GREEK LIFE; ITS CUSTOMS, ITS
SUPERSTITIONS, AND ITS PRINCELY HOSPITALITIES, FOR WHICH REASON THEY ARE
GIVEN AT SOMEWHAT GREATER LENGTH THAN IS USUAL IN WORKS OF THE KIND.

IN A CHAPTER DEVOTED TO THE PURPOSE SOME INTERESTING PARTICULARS HAVE BEEN
COLLECTED RESPECTING THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND ROMANS
(MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE FORMER), TO WHICH IS SUBJOINED AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR
PRINCIPAL FESTIVALS.

I MAY ADD THAT NO PAINS HAVE BEEN SPARED IN ORDER THAT, WITHOUT PASSING
OVER DETAILS THE OMISSION OF WHICH WOULD HAVE {II} MARRED THE COMPLETENESS
OF THE WORK, NOT A SINGLE PASSAGE SHOULD BE FOUND WHICH COULD POSSIBLY
OFFEND THE MOST SCRUPULOUS DELICACY; AND ALSO THAT I HAVE PURPOSELY TREATED
THE SUBJECT WITH THAT REVERENCE WHICH I CONSIDER DUE TO EVERY RELIGIOUS
SYSTEM, HOWEVER ERRONEOUS.

IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO DWELL UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY OF
MYTHOLOGY: OUR POEMS, OUR NOVELS, AND EVEN OUR DAILY JOURNALS TEEM WITH
CLASSICAL ALLUSIONS; NOR CAN A VISIT TO OUR ART GALLERIES AND MUSEUMS BE
FULLY ENJOYED WITHOUT SOMETHING MORE THAN A MERE SUPERFICIAL KNOWLEDGE OF A
SUBJECT WHICH HAS IN ALL AGES INSPIRED PAINTERS, SCULPTORS, AND POETS. IT
THEREFORE ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO EXPRESS A HOPE THAT MY LITTLE WORK MAY
PROVE USEFUL, NOT ONLY TO TEACHERS AND SCHOLARS, BUT ALSO TO A LARGE CLASS
OF GENERAL READERS, WHO, IN WHILING AWAY A LEISURE HOUR, MAY DERIVE SOME
PLEASURE AND PROFIT FROM ITS PERUSAL.
